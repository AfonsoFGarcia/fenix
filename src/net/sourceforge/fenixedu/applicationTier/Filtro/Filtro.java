/**
 * This class is the superclass of all Filter. A Filter class is responsible for
 * ensuring that a given service can be invoked by a certain user or by changing
 * the arguments that should be processed by the service. Filter classes must
 * also define a public static method, called getInstance, that returns an
 * instance of the filter class. This method is called through reflection. If
 * the Filter class does not maintain any state, then this method should return
 * a singleton instance.
