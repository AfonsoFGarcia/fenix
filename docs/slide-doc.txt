max packet size in mysql must be changed, use the following line:
set-variable = max_allowed_packet=11M
#2
the blob column in revisioncontent for content only accepts 64K, must be changed to longblob
#3
there are known issues with slide having a longblob in the revision content table.
ISSUES:
PROPFIND on anything other than the standard DAV properties; it throws a 404
Not Found in the logs
solutions:
#3.1
In the property table there is a column called namespace, and all the
standard DAV properties have the entry 'DAV:' in this column for their
tuples.  I have found that if I insert 'DAV:' in this column for my property
tuples, then I can do PROPFIND.  

It would be nice to not have to use ContentInterceptor (or indeed a custom
database handler) to 'insert' this for every property I PROPPATCH on file
upload... as its not v elegant.
#3.2
Just for the record, I have found out how to patch in namespace 'DAV:' to
every property that gets PROPPATCH'd, rather than just the actual DAV
properties.  If you modify the code on line 2796 of WebdavResource so that
the code that reads:
Method.addPropertyToSet(name, value);
Is changed to:
Method.addPropertyToSet(name, value, "DAV:", "DAV:");
Then you can PROPFIND to your heart's content...
For the record, this seems to sort the problem for either FileContentStore
or JDBCContentStore.
